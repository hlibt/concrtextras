The Visual Studio 2010 RC has been released and is available for download at: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx.

Visual Studio 2010 includes libraries and tools to help developers be more 
productive at writing parallel and concurrent applications. 
For native C++ developers this includes the Parallel Pattern Library (PPL) 
which includes task parallelism constructs, thread-safe containers and 
synchronization primitive, the Asynchronous Agents Library an actor based 
programming model base on asynchronous message passing and the underlying 
Concurrency Runtime (ConcRT).

This Code Gallery project includes example applications, short samples and 
utilities that demonstrate the native Parallel Libraries and further 
enhance the library with useful (but unsupported) extra functionality.
